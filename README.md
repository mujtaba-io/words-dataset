# words-dataset
List of all words in every possible language. -- Words are extracted using large volumes of diverse texts, by slicing each word, and then sorting them in a list. - Additionally, I also want to make a data structure to map each word in each language to all of its possible translations to every other language. This structure can be like a graph.

## instructions
all data is in `/data` directory, rest of the files/folders are for data collection only.
